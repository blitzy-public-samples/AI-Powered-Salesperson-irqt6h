## 7.5 DATA-FLOW DIAGRAM

The following diagram illustrates how information moves through the AI-powered salesperson chat system:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Input] --> B[NLP Processor]
    B --> C[RAG Engine]
    C --> D[Knowledge Base]
    D --> C
    C --> E[Quote Service]
    E --> F[SKU Catalog]

    K[Admin Input] --> L[System Configuration]
    L --> M[AI Model Updates]
    M --> C
    L --> N[Pricing Rules]
    N --> G
```

In this data flow:

1. User input is processed by the NLP component to extract intent and entities.
2. The RAG engine retrieves relevant information from the knowledge base to enhance the understanding of the request.
3. The Quote Service uses the processed information to fetch relevant SKUs from the catalog.
4. The Pricing Engine applies business rules and dynamic pricing to generate a quote.
5. The generated quote is presented to the user and optionally integrated with the CRM system.
6. Admins can configure the system, update AI models, and modify pricing rules, which feed back into the quote generation process.

This architecture ensures a seamless flow of information from user input to quote generation, leveraging AI components and integrating with external systems to provide accurate and context-aware responses.
